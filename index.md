## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profilepic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a senior Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University and will soon begin a Master’s degree in Systems Engineering. My academic and professional experiences span design, testing, and manufacturing, where I have worked on hands-on, multidisciplinary engineering projects and internships that emphasize both technical rigor and real-world impact. I am particularly interested in how complex systems are designed, analyzed, and brought from concept to production. Outside of engineering, I enjoy running, skiing, and fishing, activities that reflect my appreciation for challenge, problem-solving, and the outdoors.
