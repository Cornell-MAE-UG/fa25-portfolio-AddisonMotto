As part of MAE 4272, my team was tasked with designing, manufacturing, and experimentally validating a small-scale horizontal-axis wind turbine blade. The primary objective of the project was to maximize the turbine’s coefficient of power (C<sub>P</sub>) within the constraints of the Big Blue wind tunnel facility and the mechanical limits of the experimental hardware. This required translating aerodynamic theory into a physically realizable blade geometry that could operate safely, efficiently, and repeatably at low Reynolds numbers.

The project emphasized the full engineering workflow: aerodynamic modeling, design iteration, fabrication considerations, experimental testing, and post-processing of performance data. Rather than producing a purely theoretical design, the blade was evaluated under real flow conditions using controlled torque loading, allowing us to directly compare predicted performance with experimental results.

The blade geometry was developed using Blade Element Momentum (BEM) theory, which combines actuator disk momentum relationships with two-dimensional blade element aerodynamics. Our model solved for the spanwise chord and twist distributions required to meet a target tip-speed ratio of approximately 5, a value chosen to balance aerodynamic efficiency with structural and operational limits of the test setup.

Because the turbine operates at small scale, the blade experiences relatively low Reynolds numbers across most of its span. To account for this, the design was based around a representative Reynolds number of approximately 50,000. Lift and drag data were taken from low-Re airfoil studies, and the Selig 7075 airfoil was selected due to its favorable lift-to-drag performance in this regime. The blade was designed to operate at a near-constant angle of attack of approximately 6–6.5 degrees, corresponding to the airfoil’s peak aerodynamic efficiency.

Finite blade effects were incorporated into the design through Prandtl’s tip loss factor, which reduced the effective lift near the blade tip and influenced the final chord distribution. Using this corrected formulation, the BEM model predicted a peak coefficient of power of approximately 0.45 at the design tip-speed ratio. This theoretical prediction served as a benchmark for evaluating experimental performance.

Experimental validation was conducted in the Big Blue wind tunnel using a controlled torque-loading methodology. The turbine was mounted securely in the test section and connected to an electromagnetic braking system, allowing the applied load to be varied through changes in brake voltage. Wind speeds ranging from 3 m/s to 7 m/s were tested to characterize performance across the operating envelope of the turbine.

For each wind speed, testing began at free spin (0 V brake input) to establish a baseline rotational speed. The brake voltage was then increased incrementally in steps of 0.2 V, and the turbine was allowed to reach steady-state at each load condition before recording rotational speed. This process was repeated until the turbine slowed to a stop or reached the practical limits of the braking system. Free-spin RPM was monitored carefully to ensure the turbine remained within safe operating limits, and wind speed was reduced if necessary to prevent excessive rotational speeds.

This testing approach enabled the construction of full power curves for each wind speed, capturing how power output and efficiency varied with rotational speed and applied torque. Multiple runs were conducted to improve repeatability and reduce the influence of transient effects.

## Results and Performance Analysis

Experimental results showed that turbine power output increased with wind speed, as expected, but the measured coefficients of power were significantly lower than theoretical predictions. The peak C<sub>P</sub> values obtained experimentally were approximately 0.030 at 3 m/s, 0.037 at 4 m/s, 0.046 at 5 m/s, 0.062 at 6 m/s, and 0.067 at 7 m/s. While these values followed the expected trend of increasing efficiency with wind speed, they remained well below the predicted peak of the BEM model.

The discrepancy between theoretical and experimental performance highlighted several important real-world effects not fully captured in the idealized model. These include additional aerodynamic losses, surface roughness and manufacturing imperfections, flow non-uniformity in the wind tunnel, vibration and alignment issues, and mechanical losses in the drivetrain and brake system. At small scale, these factors have an outsized impact and can dominate performance, underscoring the limitations of purely theoretical optimization.

Despite the lower-than-expected efficiency, the experimental data provided valuable insight into turbine behavior and clearly demonstrated the importance of validating aerodynamic designs through physical testing.

## My Contribution

My contributions to this project spanned modeling, validation, and experimentation. I assisted in developing and implementing the BEM-based aerodynamic model in MATLAB, including incorporating airfoil performance data and tip loss corrections. I also contributed to structural and torque-related checks to ensure the blade operated well within material and mechanical limits during testing.

During experimental validation, I participated directly in wind tunnel setup, execution of torque sweep testing, and data collection. I helped process the resulting data to generate power curves and performance metrics, and contributed to interpreting discrepancies between predicted and measured results. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience bridging aerodynamic theory with experimental reality and developed a deeper appreciation for the iterative nature of engineering design.
